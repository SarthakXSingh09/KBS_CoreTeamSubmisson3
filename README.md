Blockchain Implementation using Python
This project is a minimal blockchain implementation written in Python.

The goal is to understand how blocks are created, linked, and verified using cryptographic hashing.

Each block contains:

index – Position of the block in the chain

timestamp – Time when the block was created

data – Information stored in the block

previous_hash – Hash of the previous block

nonce – Number used for Proof-of-Work

hash – SHA-256 hash of the block’s contents
